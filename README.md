symext (LaTex Symbol Package)
===============================

"symext" stands for "symbol-extention" package. It is an extension of the LaTex math symbols. The goal is to provide mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists,  linguists and professionals of other areas the ability to write non-intrusive, yet non-repetitive symbols. 

Motivation:
============
Often times, professors/professionals find themselves running out of notations to express their mathematical ideas. Most of them are reluctant to resort to exotic symbols (for a good reason), but simply relying on the context to resolve the umbiguities. But the readers/audiences may have a hard time to understand the concept when they missed some crutial points in the first place. 

Summary: 
========
This LaTex package will provide the user the ability to writing 80 more intuitive & unobstrusive symbols to their mathematical languages. These symbols are based on English letters: a, b, d, e, g, o, p and q.
